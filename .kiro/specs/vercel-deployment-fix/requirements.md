# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the production deployment failure issue when uploading the Vue 3 + Vite project's dist files to Vercel. The goal is to establish a reliable deployment pipeline that successfully builds and serves the application on Vercel's production environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to successfully deploy my Vue 3 + Vite application to Vercel, so that my application is accessible in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is deployed to Vercel THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully without errors
2. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the application SHALL be accessible via the Vercel-provided URL
3. WHEN users access the deployed application THEN all static assets (CSS, JS, images) SHALL load correctly
4. WHEN the application loads THEN all Vue components and routing SHALL function as expected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Vercel configuration, so that the deployment process is optimized for my Vue/Vite setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vercel builds the project THEN it SHALL use the correct Node.js version and build commands
2. WHEN static files are served THEN they SHALL have appropriate caching headers and routing rules
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL handle Vue Router's history mode correctly for SPA routing
4. IF there are environment-specific configurations THEN they SHALL be properly configured for production

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand and fix the current deployment errors, so that I can prevent similar issues in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment errors occur THEN the root cause SHALL be identified and documented
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be tested and verified to work
3. WHEN the deployment succeeds THEN the solution SHALL be documented for future reference
4. IF there are build or runtime errors THEN they SHALL be resolved with appropriate fixes
