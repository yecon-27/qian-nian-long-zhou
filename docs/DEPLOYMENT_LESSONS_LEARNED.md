# Deployment Lessons Learned

## Project Overview

This document captures the key lessons learned during the deployment of the "千年龙舟创意新生" Vue 3 + Vite application to Vercel, including the root causes of issues encountered and the solutions implemented.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Framework Preset Override

**Problem:** The main deployment failure was caused by Vercel's "Vite" framework preset overriding the custom `vercel.json` configuration.

**Root Cause:** When a framework preset is selected in Vercel, it takes precedence over custom configuration files, causing the build system to use `vite build` directly instead of the npm scripts defined in `package.json`.

**Impact:** This led to build failures because:
1. The `vite` command was not available in the build environment
2. Custom build steps (type checking, dependency installation) were skipped
3. Environment variables and build optimizations were not applied correctly

**Solution:** Changed the Framework Preset from "Vite" to "Other" in Vercel project settings, allowing custom configuration to take effect.

### Secondary Issues and Solutions

#### 1. SPA Routing Configuration

**Issue:** Direct URL access resulted in 404 errors
**Cause:** Missing single-page application routing configuration
**Solution:** Added rewrites configuration in `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Environment Variable Configuration

**Issue:** Environment variables not loading in production
**Cause:** Variables not properly configured for production environment
**Solution:** 
- Ensured all client-side variables use `VITE_` prefix
- Set variables specifically for "Production" environment in Vercel
- Used relative API paths (`/api`) instead of absolute URLs

#### 3. Build Script Optimization

**Issue:** Build process not optimized for production
**Cause:** Missing production-specific build configuration
**Solution:** Enhanced build scripts in `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm install && npm run type-check && npm run build-only",
    "vercel-build": "npm install && npm run type-check && npm run build-only"
  }
}
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Framework Presets vs Custom Configuration

**Learning:** Vercel's framework presets can override custom configurations, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Best Practice:** 
- Use "Other" framework preset for projects with custom build requirements
- Always test deployment configuration in preview environment first
- Document any deviations from standard framework configurations

### 2. Environment Variable Management

**Learning:** Environment variables require careful configuration for different deployment environments.

**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent naming conventions (`VITE_` prefix for client-side variables)
- Set variables for specific environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- Use relative paths for API endpoints in production
- Document all required environment variables

### 3. Build Process Optimization

**Learning:** Production builds require different optimization strategies than development builds.

**Best Practices:**
- Implement code splitting for better performance
- Configure proper asset handling and caching
- Include type checking in production builds
- Use relative base paths for better portability

### 4. SPA Routing Considerations

**Learning:** Single-page applications require special routing configuration for direct URL access.

**Best Practices:**
- Always configure catch-all routing for SPAs
- Test direct URL access to all routes
- Implement proper 404 handling
- Consider SEO implications of client-side routing

## Configuration Best Practices

### Vercel Project Settings
```
Framework Preset: Other
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
Node.js Version: 18.x or higher
```

### Essential Files

1. **vercel.json** - Custom deployment configuration
2. **package.json** - Build scripts and dependencies
3. **vite.config.ts** - Build optimization settings
4. **Environment files** - Development and production configurations

### Required Environment Variables
- All API endpoints configured with relative paths
- Mock data disabled for production
- Authentication and security features enabled
- Version and title information configured

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Deployment Testing
1. Local build and preview testing
2. Environment variable verification
3. Cross-browser compatibility testing
4. Performance and accessibility audits

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Smoke testing of all major features
2. API connectivity verification
3. Route accessibility testing
4. Performance monitoring setup

## Documentation Strategy

### Created Documentation
1. **Complete Deployment Guide** - Comprehensive step-by-step instructions
2. **Troubleshooting Quick Reference** - Emergency fixes and common issues
3. **Deployment Checklist** - Pre and post-deployment verification steps
4. **Environment Setup Guide** - Detailed environment variable configuration

### Documentation Principles
- Provide both comprehensive guides and quick references
- Include specific error messages and solutions
- Maintain troubleshooting decision trees
- Document emergency procedures and rollback plans

## Future Recommendations

### 1. Automation Improvements
- Implement automated deployment testing
- Set up continuous integration checks
- Create deployment health checks
- Automate environment variable validation

### 2. Monitoring and Alerting
- Implement error tracking and monitoring
- Set up performance monitoring
- Create deployment success/failure notifications
- Monitor API connectivity and response times

### 3. Process Improvements
- Establish deployment approval workflows
- Create staging environment for testing
- Implement feature flag management
- Document rollback procedures

### 4. Team Knowledge Sharing
- Conduct deployment post-mortems
- Share lessons learned across projects
- Create deployment training materials
- Establish deployment best practices

## Preventive Measures

### To Avoid Similar Issues in Future Projects:

1. **Always use "Other" framework preset** for projects with custom build requirements
2. **Test deployment configuration early** in the development process
3. **Document all custom configurations** and their reasons
4. **Implement comprehensive testing** before production deployment
5. **Maintain up-to-date documentation** for all deployment procedures

### Configuration Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Framework preset set correctly
- [ ] Build commands tested locally
- [ ] Environment variables configured for all environments
- [ ] SPA routing configured properly
- [ ] Asset paths configured for production
- [ ] Performance optimizations implemented

## Success Metrics

### Deployment Success Criteria:
- Build completes without errors
- Application loads correctly in production
- All routes accessible via direct URLs
- API connections functional
- Performance meets requirements
- No critical errors in monitoring

### Performance Benchmarks:
- First Contentful Paint < 2s
- Largest Contentful Paint < 4s
- Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- First Input Delay < 100ms

## Conclusion

The deployment challenges encountered were primarily due to framework preset configuration conflicts and missing SPA routing setup. The solutions implemented provide a solid foundation for future deployments and serve as a reference for similar Vue 3 + Vite projects.

The comprehensive documentation created ensures that future deployments can be executed smoothly and any issues can be quickly diagnosed and resolved.
