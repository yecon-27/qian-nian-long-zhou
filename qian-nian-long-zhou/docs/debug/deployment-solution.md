# Vercel Deployment Solution

## Issue Identified

The Vercel project is configured with a "Vite" framework preset that overrides the vercel.json configuration and tries to run `vite build` directly instead of using npm scripts. This causes the deployment to fail because the vite command is not available in the build environment.

## Current Project Configuration

```
Framework Preset: Vite
Build Command: `npm run build` or `vite build`
Output Directory: None
Install Command: `yarn install`, `pnpm install`, `npm install`, or `bun install`
Node.js Version: 22.x
```

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Update Project Settings in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/yecon-27s-projects/qian-nian-long-zhou/settings
2. Navigate to "Build & Output Settings"
3. Change Framework Preset from "Vite" to "Other"
4. Set Build Command to: `npm run build`
5. Set Output Directory to: `dist`
6. Save settings and redeploy

### Solution 2: Manual Deployment (Current Working Solution)

Since the local build works perfectly, we can deploy the pre-built files:

1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. The dist folder contains all the production files
3. Deploy the dist folder directly to Vercel

### Solution 3: Create New Project

1. Create a new Vercel project
2. Don't select any framework preset (choose "Other")
3. Configure build settings manually

## Current Status

- ✅ Local build works perfectly
- ✅ All configuration files are properly set up
- ✅ Application runs correctly in development and preview
- ❌ Vercel deployment fails due to framework preset override

## Next Steps

The recommended approach is to update the project settings in the Vercel dashboard to remove the Vite framework preset and use the custom build configuration.
